# JobScraper

This repository currently contains the initial scaffold for the JobScraper project.

## Structure

- `backend/`: Domain-specific packages for ingestion, profiling, analytics, compliance, and more.
- `frontend/`: Placeholder for the future user-facing application.
- `infra/`: Docker and orchestration configuration placeholders.
- `tests/`: Placeholder directory for automated tests.

Each backend package exposes a module-level docstring describing its intended responsibility.
